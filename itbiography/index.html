<p>My name is Alexander Maes. I am 19 years old and currently a student in the 6th year of Informatica-Beheer at the Instituut Immaculata in Oostmalle. I would like to formally write some sort of autobiography about everything concerning my (IT) life, I hope this document will explain more about how I interact with IT and everything related to it.</p>
<p>My first interaction with IT was years ago, I think I was about eight years old when my parents had a small Macintosh computer. I would sometimes use that to play some very old Disney games or just to browse the, then quite slow, internet. However I did not interact with it as much as I do now, it was mainly a quite rare sight for me to interact with IT during those days. I had no real impressions because I was too young, I tried it when I was bored and it was merely something to pass the time. I do not remember the kinds of sites I visited but I rarely did use the internet, I mostly spent my time playing those Disney games. My main interaction with IT began when I was ten when my brother introduced me to World of Warcraft. He allowed me to play it and create my own ‘character’, as they would say. He explained me the basics and left me to myself as I knew nothing about the English language.</p>
<p>Today IT means a lot to me, as I already mentioned, thanks to my brother leaving me to my own devices. I started to teach myself English to be able to play games and be on the internet. Nowadays I am quite proud that I am actually able to speak English to the degree I can. IT has helped me a lot in life and has probably taken over a major part of my life, it makes sure that I have something to do when I’m not at school, doing homework and to kill my boredom. I probably spend an unhealthy amount of time using my computer, something which easily comes close to about four hours, or more, daily. This is then probably doubled, if not tripled, on the weekends when I have nothing to do in particular. A lot of people are under the impression that I am constantly gaming but in reality most of my time is devoted to programming and other developmental things on the internet. I work on things like Popcorn Time, websites for games, even cores coded in C++ and databases in SQL for certain other games. I like to be busy with something because if I don’t I will easily get bored and I’d rather not be like that. If I had to think of a reason why I find programming fascinating then I think it would be because it is something I would like to do in the future. Perhaps not necessarily programming games, but using a computer language to make certain things work just sounds amazing to me. I love to tackle challenges and the harder they are the more determined I am to figure it out and actually make it work. Depending on the subject in IT I can call myself an expert on some of them, when you ask me about hardware you’ll obviously see that I am a bit lacking as I honestly do not know the latest new parts for a computer nor do I know the upcoming ones and what’s so special about them. However, if you were to ask me something about programming specifically I sometimes can show my skills within this subject and I guess some people could call me an expert, however I think I still have a lot to learn if I look around on the internet and see some of the creations other people have made.</p>
<p>I still am not fully sure about what my future holds, I would like to get into programming full-time and perhaps one day get hired for a company to either work on games, websites or just something that relates to programming. The former two I would be more interested in than the latter obviously. That would likely be my main ambition with IT: become a computer programmer working for a company that develops games. I am aware it sounds quite cheesy but those people are always needed and just like everyone else can have an aspiration this would be mine. Nothing is impossible if you work hard enough for it and this is why I continuously try to gain more knowledge about programming and try to tackle new challenges so that one day I can use that information to work my way into a company and fulfil my dream.</p>
<p>My life has become pretty intertwined with my PC. You will rarely not see me use it for something as to me it is quite a standard tool to use. I honestly think my PC, the internet and IT has become a big part of my life these days. Without it I would probably be a lot more bored and clueless as to what I would want to do with my life. I can only be somewhat thankful that I have a way of spending my time like that.</p>
